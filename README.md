IDL CDM code optimised for SMILE CCD
CDM must deal with binning, 2 node readout, charge injection and conform as close as possible to the SMILE CCD properties and operations
Code is written in IDL
Trap parameters and CCD properties and readout values are set in setup files for different damage stages (BOL, EOL, EXT)
